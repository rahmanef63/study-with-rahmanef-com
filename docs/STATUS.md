## Proposals (shared-surface changes — integrator applies)

_none yet_

| Date | From | File(s) | Proposal | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Blocked / drift log

| Date | Agent | Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-06 | alpha | rr `dashboard-shell` facade is not liftable standalone — it imports the full superspace workspace foundation (AppSidebar, Workspace/Guest providers, onboarding, theme). Too heavy for charity v1. | Integrator decision: slice dropped from #0. `/t/[slug]` shell will be a minimal app-level layout built at #5 with shadcn primitives; revisit a full lift post-v1. `responsive-dialog` kept (component copied into the slice); `defineFeature` sanitized to `shared/features/defineFeature.ts` (no zod). |
| 2026-07-06 | alpha | Security P0 says an authz helper is first in every public Convex handler, while R2/R3/R4 and DATA-MODEL require anonymous tenant/course etalase queries. Courses also has protected ID lookups before auth. | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-06 by alpha: anonymous public-read exception added to AGENTS.md §6 (`public*` naming + active/published-only via index + safe projection). Remaining for gamma: move protected ID lookups behind `requireUser` before #2 reaches review. |
| 2026-07-06 | vps | Boundary violation: vps committed & pushed d894356 (auth.config.ts + _generated regen) — its contract allowed only `git pull --ff-only`. | Post-hoc review by alpha: content clean (no secrets, correct provider registry, typed api incl. progress), accepted. AGENTS.md §4 amended: narrow deploy-blocking-hotfix exception with mandatory alpha post-review. |
| 2026-07-06 | vps | Secret exposure: Convex admin key + JWT_PRIVATE_KEY leaked by vps filter mistakes; AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET pasted by Rahman in chat. | Rotation tracked as row #12 (URGENT, runs on VPS). Reminder reinforced: reports reference env var NAMES only. |
